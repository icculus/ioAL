# ioAL

This was me, thinking I would definitely sit down and write
a perfect OpenAL implementation that handles all cases and
platforms.

So I sat down in a coffee shop for an hour or two and
completely overengineered the basic interfaces.

I poked with this a little more after that, probably, but
even before you know you painted yourself into a
corner...you already know.

In later years, I built [MojoAL](https://icculus.org/mojoAL)
where I did this right: I assumed it would only ever be a
software implementation, I had SDL do all the heavy-lifting
where possible, and trimmed all possible bulk.

We learn a lot over time, making a lot of mistakes along the way.
This repo is just here for historical purposes, and perhaps as
an example to others.  :)
